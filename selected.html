			<p> Chinese calligraphy is an ancient art of writing Chinese characters. It has evolved from oracle bone inscriptions, stone drum inscriptions, and bronze inscriptions (Zhongding inscriptions) to large seal characters, small seal characters, and official script, to cursive, regular script, and running script, which were shaped in the Eastern Han, Wei, and Jin Dynasties. Calligraphy has always exuded artistic charm. Calligraphy of Chinese characters is an original expressive art of the Han nationality. It is known as: wordless poetry, line free dance; A picture without pictures is a silent music.

With the cross integration of planning, ecology, geography and other disciplines, it has different meanings in different disciplines. Landscape design mainly serves: urban landscape design (urban square, commercial street, office environment, etc.), residential landscape design, urban park planning and design, waterfront green space planning and design, tourism resort and scenic area planning and design, etc
